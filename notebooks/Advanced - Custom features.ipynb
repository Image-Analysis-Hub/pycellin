But some features require data from several elements or maybe from the whole lineage. In that case they are global. A simple example is our AgeCalculator. To compute the age of a cell you need to know when the first cell of the lineage appeared. So you need to access the data stored into 2 different cells: the cell of interest and the root of the lineage.  \n",
